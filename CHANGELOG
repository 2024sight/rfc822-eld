-------------------------------

  - Enhanced the main function so that it can check full email addresses, or just local parts and domain names.
    If it has been asked to check whether  a string is a full address, having been provided with just a local
    part or domain, it will return an error. If the email address itself is syntactically incorrect, it will
    also produce an error. Similarly, it can check whether a string might be a suitable local part or a suitable
    domain name. By default the function will behave as before. 

  - Fixed the code that drives the comment checking so that it fails if a comment is used and the flag is disabled.

  - Fixed the testing and home page php code so that it works in today's world.
